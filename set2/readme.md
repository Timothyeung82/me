TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
What I learn this week:
    Always git push before stopping and git pull before starting
    =, != is not the same, therefore you can have more = in one line
    or, and, not are all functions that can be use
    for i in range(x)... it bascially means for a number within this range of x
    Append is to add an element to the end of the list
    YOU CAN LOOP A LOOP
    str() to convert data into a string
    ('(i{}, j{})'.format(i, j))... i and j will format into the crab bracket
    indent is SUPPPPERRRR IMPORTANT!!!!!

what is still unclear:
    when to use str()
    how to use for-loop is situation where i dont know what the end goal is
    programing terminology
    the correct python syntax

W3 saves life!!!
